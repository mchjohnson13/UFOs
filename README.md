## Summary
A couple draw backs of this design include no easy way to clear inputs and needing dropdowns or auto-guessing when adding filter inputs.  
  
Having to manually delete the inputs is a little annoying. Having a button to clear all inputs would be a nice addition.  
  
Because the filter is case-senstive and a user might not know what cities (etc) are in the table, a dropdown that gives the possible entries would be really helpful.
