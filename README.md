# UFO Webpage with Filtering Table
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that includes a filterable table with UFO sighting data. When a new filter value is entered into any of the text boxes, the table automatically updates with the filtered data. The table is also able to be filtered by multiple filter values.

## Results
Upon opening the website, the table will load with all data entries.

### Using Filters
The table can be filtered by entering filter values into the textboxes to the left. The table can be filtered by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.
#### Filter by date (1/5/2010)

### Multiple Filters
Adding multiple entries to the filter search will filter the table by all of the filter criteria.
  
#### Filter by date, state, and shape (1/1/2010, ca, triangle)

## Summary
A couple draw backs of this design include no easy way to clear inputs and needing dropdowns or auto-guessing when adding filter inputs.  
  
Having to manually delete the inputs is a little annoying. Including a button to clear all inputs would be a nice addition.  
  
Because the filter is case-senstive and a user might not know what cities (etc) are in the table, a dropdown that gives the possible entries would be really helpful.
